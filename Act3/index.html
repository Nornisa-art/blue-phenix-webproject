            <h2>Nature</h2>
            <p>Nature is an inherent character or constitution, particularly of the ecosphere or the universe as a whole. 
                In this general sense nature refers to the laws, elements and phenomena of the physical world, including life. 
                Although humans are part of nature, human activity or humans as a whole are often described as at times at odds, or outright separate and even superior to nature.</p>

            <h2 class="two">Lifestyle</h2>
            <p>ifestyle is the interests, opinions, behaviours, and behavioural orientations of an individual, group, or culture. 
                The term "style of life" (German: Lebensstil) was introduced by Austrian psychologist Alfred Adler in his 1929 book, 
                The Case of Miss R., with the meaning of "a person's basic character as established early in childhood".
                 The broader sense of lifestyle as a "way or style of living" has been documented since 1961.</p>
