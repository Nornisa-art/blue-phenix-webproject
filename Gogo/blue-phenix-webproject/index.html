            <h4>Track Your Money</h4>
            <p>You can use banking apps to check balances and categorize transactions, budgeting apps like Mint or YNAB for structured tracking, and spreadsheets for manual tracking. The envelope system helps control spending by setting limits for each category. Regularly reviewing credit card and debit card statements also helps identify spending patterns. For freelancers, apps like QuickBooks help track income, while tools like Truebill manage subscriptions. Tracking your net worth can provide a comprehensive view of your finances, and manual tracking with pen and paper is always an option for those who prefer it. Consistency in tracking is key to managing finances effectively.</p>

            <h6>Secure Your Account</h6>
            <p>To secure your bank account, start by using strong, unique passwords for each account and enabling two-factor authentication (2FA) to add an extra layer of security. Always use a secure internet connection, avoiding public Wi-Fi, and ensure your devices have updated software with anti-malware protection. Regularly monitor your account for suspicious activity and set up alerts for transactions. Be cautious of phishing scams and never share your bank details via email or phone. Use a strong PIN for your cards, and consider changing it regularly. If your card is lost or stolen, report it immediately to your bank. A password manager can help you securely store and generate strong passwords, and when using ATMs, always check for skimmers and cover the keypad while entering your PIN. By following these steps, you can significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access and keep your bank account safe.</p>
